##Zetta RM Young 85000 Anemometer sensor driver for Linux

This driver should work on any Linux platform, but has so far only been tested on BeagleBone Black

###Install
```
$> npm install @agilatech/zetta-rmy85000-linux-driver
```
OR
```
$> git clone https://github.com/Agilatech/zetta-rmy85000-linux-driver zetta-rmy85000-linux-driver
```
###Usage

```
var zetta = require('zetta');
var rmy85000 = require('@agilatech/zetta-rmy85000-linux-driver');

zetta()
.use(rmy85000, [options])  // where [options] define operational paramters -- omit to accept defaults
.listen(<port number>)   // where <port number> is the port on which the zetta server should listen
```

####OPTIONS
These options are defined in a file named 'options.json' which may be overridden by program definitions

```
"file":"<serial file device>"
/dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyO2, etc...  Defaults to /dev/ttyS0

"chronPeriod":<period>
Period in milliseconds for monitored isochronal data

"streamPeriod":<period>
Period in milliseconds for streaming data. A value of 0 disables streaming.
```


###Example
Using directly in the zetta server:
```
const zetta = require('zetta');
const sensor = require('@agilatech/zetta-rmy85000-linux-driver');
zetta().use(sensor).listen(1337);
```
Initializes the rmy85000 driver on serial device /dev/ttyS0 with a data monitoring period of 60 seconds and streaming data every second.

To override the options defined in the options.json file, supply them in an object in the use statement like this:
```
zetta().use(sensor, { "file":"/dev/ttyS2", "chronPeriod":30000, "streamPeriod":15000 });
```
Overrides the defaults to initialize the serial device on **/dev/ttyS2** with a data monitoring period of **30 seconds** and streaming data every **1.5 seconds**

### Hardware

* Beaglebone Black
* Beaglebone Green
* Should also work on Raspberry Pi as well as other Linux SBC

###Transitions
```
start-isochronal
```
Begins the periodic collection of sensor data. Wind speed and direction values are monitored,
and the period is set by the 'chronPeriod' option (defaults to 60 sec).

```
stop-isochronal
```
Stops data collection for the monitored values.

###State
**chron-off** is the beginning state.  The driver enters this state after a transition '*stop-isochronal*' command.  In this state, the monitored data values are set to 0, and no sensor readings are updated.

**chron-on** is the state after a transition '*start-isochronal*' command.  In this state, the monitored data values are updated every time period as specified by '*chronPeriod*'.

###Design

This device driver is designed for both streaming and periodic monitored data collection from the RM Young 85000 Anemometer.  Wind speed and direction values are instantaneous, with no averaging or time weighting performed.  Any analysis of averages and gusts will need to be performed downstream of this driver.
